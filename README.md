D√©j√† Void

Theme: Loop
Duration: 3 Days (GMTK Game Jam 2025)
Engine: Unity (C#)
Role: Programmer & Level Designer
Team: 3 members (I handled all coding)
Playable build: itch.io - D√©j√† Void

About the Game

D√©j√† Void is a short experimental 2D game built around the theme Loop.
The player is trapped in an endless cycle, trying to escape repetition through exploration and timing.
This was my first completed game, developed during the 2025 GMTK Game Jam, where I learned how to structure gameplay systems and build a functional prototype under time pressure.

Technical Details

Engine: Unity 6 (C#)

Core systems: player controller, respawn & loop mechanics, collision & trigger logic

Level design: handcrafted in Unity Editor

Version control: Plastic SCM + GitHub

Development time: 72 hours

Challenges

As my first full project, the main challenge was understanding how game logic ties together ‚Äî physics, triggers, and camera systems.
Through trial and error, I built a working gameplay loop and learned how to debug effectively under limited time.

Outcome & Learnings

This project gave me a solid grasp of game architecture, iteration, and scope management.
It also motivated me to start developing a larger solo project afterward.
D√©j√† Void marks the beginning of my journey in game development.
